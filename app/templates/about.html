        <h3 class="text-center">The Gab/Duel Folks combine casual discussion with engaging debates.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Every post includes two authors. They are separated into two groups: Gab and Duel.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Gab</h3>
        <p>
            The Gab section focuses on creating a platform for people to engage in open and
            constructive conversations. Topics include current events, pop culture, personal experiences, and more.
            Posts feature guest bloggers and interviews with individuals from various backgrounds, bringing
            diverse perspectives and insights to the community.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">Duel</h3>
        <p>
            The Duel section involves hosting debates and discussions where authors express
            their opinions on everything. Each author is on opposing sides of a topic or expresses dissimilar
            viewpoints. Duel also includes competitions or challenges, at the authors' choices. These posts
            cover a wide range of topics, including anything from technology and science to arts
            and entertainment, ensuring there's something for everyone.

            Intensity scale
            <span> <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename="images/art/star.png") }}" alt="fireball"
                        class="image-sm">
            </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Authors assign their posts an intensity level, which is indicated by the number of
            flames or stars. Flames are used for Duel posts, while stars are used for Gab posts.
            The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 being the least intense and 5 being the most intense. Factors that
            affect intensity include the controversial nature of the topic, the author's tone,
            and the author's level of passion.
