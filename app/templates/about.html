            Authors assign their posts an intensity level, which is indicated by the number of
            flames or stars. Flames are used for Duel posts, while stars are used for Gab posts.
            The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 being the least intense and 5 being the most intense. Factors that
            affect intensity include the controversial nature of the topic, the author's tone,
            and the author's level of passion.
